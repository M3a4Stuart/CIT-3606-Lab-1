          Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was released as a public alpha for personal computers in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens "Jeb" Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021. In September 2014, Mojang and the rights to Minecraft were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion.
